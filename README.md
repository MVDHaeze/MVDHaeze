I am a self-educated developer who enjoyed discovering and trying new things
In June 2017, I graduated from business school in my home city, Brussels. I started working in financial services as business analyst and later product owner on digital transformation projects. After 3 years, I quit to move for a new challenge in Shenzhen, China - but the coronavirus got me first! 
With my plan upside down, I tried to focus on what I enjoy and started my path to become full stack developer without really knwoing what will come out of it. Since then, I tried to gather as much experience through personal projects and helping others on theirs own projects.
